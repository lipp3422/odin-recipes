# odin-recipes
<!-- This is my first ever project after learning the basics in html in TOP (The Odin Project).

The project is a recipe website. As the project goes on I will update this README to share my thoughts. -->

<!-- created my index.html file and recipes folder with apple-crisp.html inside of it. I also added the link to apple-crisp.html to index.html -->

<!-- created link back to Homepage (index.html) from recipe page -->

<!-- Changed the original apple crisp photo with a free use one. Credit for apple crisp photo is as follows: Author is Infrogmation of New Orleans, link to photo https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fresh_baked_apple_crisp_01.jpg, no changes were made to photo. -->

<!-- To add on to the comment above me, added a description of the photo as well as set height and width to properly fit on webpage. -->

<!-- added a description paragraph for the apple crisp recipe and added an ingredients header under the description which I also put in an unordered list of the ingredients-->

<!-- added a directions header with an ordered list of directions for the recipe under it -->

<!-- created lasagna.html file, created html boilerplate inside, added in title, added in link to homepage (index.html), added in picture of lasagna in images folder, as well as lasagna.html with alt description of photo as well as height and width of photo to fit webpage -->

<!-- added description of lasagna recipe, added ingredients header, added unordered list of ingredients, added directions header -->

<!-- added ordered list of directions -->

<!-- added chicken-fried-steak.html, added html boilerplate, added title, added link to index.html, added chicken fried steak header, edited index.html with link to chicken-fried-steak.html -->

<!-- added in link of chicken-fried-steak.jpg with alt description and height and width -->

<!-- I'm just about finished with this project, I have to admit that at first I was kind of intimidated, but once I added my first photo to the recipe and gave credit to the author in the README, everything got a lot easier. I definitely thing the hardest thing was doing the first recipe with the hardest thing in the first recipe being the photo, mainly because of giving credit to the author (it was just kind of confusing how to do it properly). After the first recipe, everything just kind of fell into place, sure I had to look at some past lessons to remember the code for specific things, but after that, a lot of it was copy and paste. This project has definitely opened my eyes to just how involved websites really are, and this website isn't even that involved. It gets me excited to see what else I'm going to do in this course because I already surprised myself with creating something like this. I think it's very cool. Thank you 'The Odin Project' and all contributors to making this course free and easy to follow <3 -->

<!-- this is all in chicken-fried-steak.html...added description header with paragraph under it explaining the recipe, added ingredients header with unordered list of ingredients under it and add directions header with ordered list of directions under it.....I've checked the website/page and everything works. I'm very proud of myself for doing this. I started this course on 10/9/25 and today is 10/14/25, one day before my 30th birthday. I truly hope I can use this course to learn everything I know and start to make my own projects from scratch and start to do some freelance work while I wait to retire from my current job which will be in less than a decade. If I can do that I hope to build a good enough portfolio to be able to get a job when I retire in a couple years.-->
