# odin-recipes
<!-- This is my first ever project after learning the basics in html in TOP (The Odin Project).

The project is a recipe website. As the project goes on I will update this README to share my thoughts. -->

<!-- created my index.html file and recipes folder with apple-crisp.html inside of it. I also added the link to apple-crisp.html to index.html -->
